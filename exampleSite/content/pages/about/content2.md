Owner and proprietor, Andy Rainey, has been building and fixing things from as young as he can remember. For his seventh birthday he received a new bicycle. He taught himself how to take the bike apart and rebuild it. This was the beginning of his self-taught journey. At age 13 he began remodeling. He taught himself many trades and leveraged these skills to earn money to put himself through college. In college he studied mechnical engineering and metrology, the science of measurements.

Andyâ€™s experience has allowed him to travel to other countries to rebuild and renovate homes, schools and hospitals. He has a strong faith in Christ and passion for using his talents to serve others.

With Andy you can rest assured that your home is in good hands.
