Completely renovated the bathroom. This included installing a shower valve, installing cement boards in the shower, cement boards on the floor, tile for the showers and floor, installing the vanity and mirror, installing the faucet, installing the lights, installing the shower door, and painting the walls. The shower tiles are big singular tiles so there is only three total and the shower door opens both ways.
